## Detailed Dataset Descriptions

### Original Datasets

This dataset represents an edge case that most interaction models would struggle with but might be important in certain real-world scenarios.

## Recommendations for Model Testing

Based on the characteristics of these datasets, here are some recommendations for testing your game-theoretic extensions of logistic regression:

1. **Test with Different Coalition Lengths**: Since your model can restrict itself to looking at interactions between coalitions of different lengths, test it with various restrictions (e.g., individual effects only, pairs only, triplets only, etc.) on each dataset to see how performance changes.

2. **Evaluate Scaling Properties**: Test how your model's performance and computational efficiency scale with increasing coalition sizes, from pairwise interactions up to the extreme coalition dataset.

3. **Compare with Baseline Models**: Compare your model against standard logistic regression and other non-linear models (e.g., random forests, neural networks) to quantify the advantage of your game-theoretic extensions.

4. **Analyze Feature Importance**: Examine which features and interactions your model identifies as important and compare with the ground truth from the dataset generation process.

5. **Evaluate Interpretability**: Assess how well the model's interpretability is maintained as you allow for more complex interactions.

6. **Test Computational Efficiency**: Measure the computational cost as you increase the coalition length restrictions, especially on the higher-dimensional datasets.

7. **Analyze Edge Cases**: Pay special attention to how your model performs on the nested interaction dataset and the extreme coalition dataset, as these represent challenging edge cases.

## Conclusion

These fifteen synthetic datasets provide a comprehensive testbed for evaluating game-theoretic extensions of logistic regression. They cover various types of non-linear interactions, different feature dimensionalities, varying degrees of sparsity and complexity, and a range of coalition sizes from pairwise up to all-feature interactions.

The datasets are designed to challenge the model's ability to capture complex interactions while maintaining interpretability, which is the core objective of your research. By testing your model on these datasets with different coalition length restrictions, you should be able to characterize its strengths and limitations effectively.

Each dataset file includes a header comment describing its characteristics, and the accompanying statistics and correlation plots provide additional insights into the data structure. These resources should help you understand the behavior of your model and refine it accordingly.

The enhanced datasets with higher-order interactions address the need for more comprehensive testing of your model's ability to handle complex interactions beyond just pairwise and triplet interactions. They provide edge cases and challenging scenarios that will help you fully characterize your model's capabilities and limitations.
