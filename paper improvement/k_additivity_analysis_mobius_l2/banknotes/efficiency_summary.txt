============================================================

OPTIMAL K VALUES FOR EFFICIENCY (performance/complexity tradeoff):
- Best k for accuracy efficiency: 1 (eff: 0.8305, params: 6)
- Best k for noise robustness efficiency: 1 (eff: 0.8301, params: 6)
- Best k for stability efficiency: 1 (eff: 0.8305, params: 6)
